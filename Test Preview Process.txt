"Edit the backyard image by adding a sketched pondless waterfall feature along the rear fence. Include a raised berm (+24‚Äù above grade) with clustered natural boulders, a blue water cascade drawn in a freeform curve, and planting blocks of native shrubs around it. Use hand-drawn, top-down sketch style with watercolor-like textures: green lawn, blue water, gray stones, labeled zones, and thin black annotations. Keep the firepit and hosta bed area unchanged."
